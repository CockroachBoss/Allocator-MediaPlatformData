Uniqueness: We are a web3 media platform. There are rich media platform resources. We first load the classic web3 media platform and the company's data content into the Filecoin network.
Brand-newness: Most of the data on Filecoin was web2 media data before, but in web3, a large number of daily news, article releases, exhibition content and other files, pictures and video data need to be stored in a completely decentralized place. .

Client Diligence
10. Who are your target clients?:
Enterprise Data Clients, Other (specified above)

11. Describe in as much detail as possible how you will perform due diligence on clients. If you are proposing an automated pathway, what diligence mechanism will you use to determine client eligibility?:
Following is our process:
Get more detailed information from clients according to our requirements
Verify the validity and authenticity of the information submitted, and reject applications which contacted invalid or false information.
Communicate with the applicant to provide additional information based on the suspicious points
Score the application and find out the qualified clients.
Determine the DataCap amount according to the score
Regular audit of clients’ allocations

12. Please specify how many questions you’ll ask, and provide a brief overview of the questions.:
First of all, we will review the applicants, who need to upload relevant information, including the years of registration, industry influence and so on. After the approval, we will conduct regular verification. Customers who meet the requirements can continue to use or apply for a higher volume. Those who do not meet the requirements and do not provide reasons will be rejected. We will try to find out high-quality clients with long-term storage needs.
We have the corresponding audit, such as the allocation of policy table information, and communicate with customers of different levels on different issues, including (no limit) as follows:
① Team/personal introduction
② How much DataCap do you want, and why?
③ How will you allocate your DataCap?
④Have you ever allocated before? If yes, could you give us more details?
⑤ What will you do to avoid the datacap waste?

13. Will you use a 3rd-party Know your client (KYC) service?:
YES, there will be using Togggle. However, the client has to pay.

14. Can any client apply to your pathway, or will you be closed to only your own internal clients? (eg: bizdev or self-referral):
Web3 media platforms, web2 media companies, and any promotional media companies can apply. The information on media platforms is the testimony of various industries, and a ""data set""/""channel"" is needed to form such a resource package.

15. How do you plan to track the rate at which DataCap is being distributed to your clients?:
Periodically review and audit DataCap usage (as metioned above, records are tracked and reviewed periodically to determine disqualification or demotion of nonconforming customers) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-FWdhQo808HO47Atl2h2Uj3vEnLnabtq9Drcjel4-X4/edit?usp=sharing Users can upgrade according to the actual situation to meet the requirements Communicate with customers regularly to understand relevant requirements and progress, and provide better service to customers Of course, try to avoid this situation in the initial review of the application and improve the initial application information supplement during the continuous record review process.

Acknowledge

17. What type(s) of data would be applicable for your pathway?:
Public Open Commercial/Enterprise, Private Commercial/Enterprise, Private Non-Profit/Social Impact

18. How will you verify a client’s data ownership? Will you use 3rd-party KYB (know your business) service to verify enterprise clients?:
They have to provide a business license, Official website, media link,.etc

19. How will you ensure the data meets local & regional legal requirements?:
Their business license will be recorded in our files, will not be disclosed unless necessary, and will not be disclosed without permission.

Media data are all general-purpose data. I will not provide data processing tools, but I will recommend customers to use the toolkits that have been developed in the ecosystem.

21. What tools or methodology will you use to sample and verify the data aligns with your pathway?:
Sample data should be no less than 1G

Data Distribution
22. How many replicas will you require to meet programmatic requirements for distribution?:
5+

23. What geographic or regional distribution will you require?:
THREE OR MORE regions including unique geopolitical/language coverage, each replica at different physical location, no or minimal VPN, different SP owner operators

24. How many Storage Provider owner/operators will you require to meet programmatic requirements for distribution?:
5+

25. Do you require equal percentage distribution for your clients to their chosen SPs? Will you require preliminary SP distribution plans from the client before allocating any DataCap?:
The allocation ratio of the customer's search SP does not need to be evenly distributed, and the maximum allocation of the customer's lead SP is allowed not to exceed 30%. Customers need to announce the SP of this round in advance before each round of distribution. Each round of packaging will be compared with the website https://datacapstats.io/ and recorded. If a customer has two consecutive rounds of discrepancies, the allocation will not proceed. Customers need to apply again, and the maximum amount for re-application is 1p. Until the 1p quota package meets the standards, you will not be allowed to apply for more quotas.

26. What tooling will you use to verify client deal-making distribution?:
AC Bot, CID Checker, etc which are available to the community.

27. How will clients meet SP distribution requirements?:
Yes, using the database based on https://filrep.io/.

28. As an allocator, do you support clients that engage in deal-making with SPs utilizing a VPN?:
SPs should provide their evidence of location while before allocation.

DataCap Allocation Strategy
29. Will you use standardized DataCap allocations to clients?:
Yes, standardized

30. Allocation Tranche Schedule to clients::
The first allocation will be 1/20 of the total application amount, and each allocation will be twice as much as the last time. Until the maximum single amount is 2p. The remaining rounds will continue to be distributed at 2p.
For example:
The client expected 10PiB datacap. 
The first allocation will be 500TiB, the second allocation will be 1000TiB, third allocation: 2000TiB, fourth: 2000TiB, fifth: 2000TiB, six: 2000TiB, seven: 500TiB.

31. Will you use programmatic or software based allocations?:
No, manually calculated & determined

32. What tooling will you use to construct messages and send allocations to clients?:
Existing notary registry tooling

33. Describe the process for granting additional DataCap to previously verified clients.:
Subsequent Allocation (SA) bot aligned with the allocation tranche scales I said.

34. Describe in as much detail as possible the tools used for: • client discoverability & applications • due diligence & investigation • bookkeeping • on-chain message construction • client deal-making behavior • tracking overall allocator health • disput:
Using existing toolings for allocation and tracking record: Github repo, checker bot, SA bot, https://datacapstats.io/clients, https://filplus.fil.org/#/ 
Using google drive for track bookkeeping all clients in this pathway.

Tools and Bookkeeping
35. Will you use open-source tooling from the Fil+ team?:
GitHub repo, Google spreadsheet, MongoDB

36. Where will you keep your records for bookkeeping? How will you maintain transparency in your allocation decisions?:
GitHub repo, Google spreadsheet

Risk Mitigation, Auditing, Compliance
37. Describe your proposed compliance check mechanisms for your own clients.:

Customers need to apply for a form through github in accordance with regulations;
The content of the form needs to include their identity introduction, subject introduction, data introduction, sample data, sp distribution, etc.;
Customers need to ensure the principle of pre-disclosure, and all temporary changes will be Disclosure is required, otherwise, it will be regarded as improper behavior;
The encapsulation situation will be determined based on the checker bot situation.
38. Describe your process for handling disputes. Highlight response times, transparency, and accountability mechanisms.:

The challenger needs to submit an open issue with a complete chain of evidence, and record and formulae it through the github repository;
Both the challenger and the person being questioned need to be published in the challenge application form at the same time;
The response time will be within 24 hours (working days) of the creation of the query form, and the processing will begin;
The processing process is as follows:
a. Each challenge application form requires at least three and up to seven active community participants for voting (active participants include but are not limited to: accounts with speech records in Slack, accounts created by Github for no less than 6 months, Notaries, managers of other channels or fil+ management team, etc...)
b. Within 48 hours after the challenge application is created, a participating ""hearing"" will be convened. After 48 hours, the members of the ""hearing"" will be determined.
c. Within 72 hours after the challenge application form is created, both parties involved in the application form will provide evidence to each other for debate.
d. 96h (4 days) after the challenge application is created, the ""hearing"" members must vote.
e. Normally, if there is evidence shown by actual ""tools"" that proves that the client is not in compliance with the rules, then the ""hearing"" step can be omitted.
f. In dispute resolution, the ""losing"" party will be re-evaluated as ""trustworthy"". For example, future application quotas need to start with small amounts in order to re-establish trust.
39. Detail how you will announce updates to tooling, pathway guidelines, parameters, and process alterations.:
I think, first of all, the first principle of using a tool is that it will be encouraged to be used in my channel only if the tool is widely accepted and verified by the community. I won't update the inspection tools too frequently unless there are general changes from the community/official team. All process changes need to create a formula issue through github and disclose it one week in advance. All customers are given 2 weeks to make adjustments and updates.

40. How long will you allow the community to provide feedback before implementing changes?:
There will be one week for public announcement, during which discussion can take place. After the issue is fully determined, the customer has two weeks to make adjustments.

41. Regarding security, how will you structure and secure the on-chain notary address? If you will utilize a multisig, how will it be structured? Who will have administrative & signatory rights?:
There will be only me to manage the address.

42. Will you deploy smart contracts for program or policy procedures? If so, how will you track and fund them?:
Smart contract is not necessary for now. If fvm is fully developed, I believe there will be a programming process update.

Monetization
43. Outline your monetization models for the services you provide as a notary allocator pathway.:
I believe that the current situation would be detrimental to the early development of this model if we design complex economic models.
I'm going to use the simplest way of pricing. Each customer will have a free quota of 2p. For the portion exceeding 2p, a price of 3Fil will be charged per T.

44. Describe your organization's structure, such as the legal entity and other business & market ventures.:
Meta Era focuses on the exploration of blockchain and metaverse, pursuing professional, comprehensive and accurate information and data. We have established collaborations with hundreds of investment institutions, web3 enterprises and industry media and communities, and held several large online summits and series of offline conferences with significant influence and the largest scale in the industry. On December 15, 2023, Meta Era, Hong Kong's leading Web 3.0 media, announced that it had received strategic investment from CertiK, the world's leading Web 3.0 security agency, and investment company CTH Group, and had reached a strategic cooperation.

45. Where will accounting for fees be maintained?:
our financial department

Past Experience, Affiliations, Reputation
46. If you've received DataCap allocation privileges before, please link to prior notary applications.:
N/A

47. How are you connected to the Filecoin ecosystem? Describe your (or your organization's) Filecoin relationships, investments, or ownership.:
We are connected to various public chains. We hold various summits from time to time. A recent conference held in Hong Kong also presented awards to FilFoundation.

48. How are you estimating your client demand and pathway usage? Do you have existing clients and an onboarding funnel?:
We have no clients now, but all the media organizations we have worked with before are potential clients, and they are very large. For example: ODAILY.NEWS, Foresight News, PANews, Blocklike, ByTOken, MarsBit, Cointime, BLOCKNEWS, WIKIBIT, CHAIN CATCHER…
